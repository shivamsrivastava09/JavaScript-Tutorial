     *.innerText -> Shows the content visible on the web page.
     *.innerHTML -> Shows the content visible on the web page or hidden in the HTML page along with the tags.
     *.innerTextContent -> Shows the content visible on the web page and shows the hidden content too.
     *.querySelector -> give the first appearence of the component in the web page.
        ex. document.querySelector('here you can write the component or its id and class').
     *.querySelectorAll -> give the all appearence of the component but in the form of NodeList,
     and to access the node list you have the traverse it in the form of array and its index.
        ex. const myList = document.querySelectorAll('h1')
            myList[0].style.color = 'green'  
     *.getElementsByClassName -> give the all appearence the component with the name provided it in
     parameter but it returns in the form of HTMLCollection so in order to make change or to access we need
     to convert it in Array.
        ex. const myList = document.getElementsByClassName('list')
            const convertedArray = Array.from(myList)
            convertedArray[0].style.color = 'green'
